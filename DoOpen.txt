/******************************************************************************
DoOpen:  use the ifttt "DO" button to open a door.
    A relay is connected to D3.  When the DO button is activated, a cloud
    message is sent to a Particle device which activates the relay for
    the number of milliseconds that is specified in the function call argument 
    that is configured on the DO button (default is 3 seconds). 
    An electronic strike plate is then connected to the NO contacts of the 
    relay to activate the door strike.
    
    The Particle "Relay Shield" is a good fit for this project.  It 
    accomodates a Core or Photon and has 4 relays, of which one is used
    to activate the electronic door strike.  It also accepts 12 VDC via
    a barrel jack and supplies the 12 VDC out some screw terminals, which
    can be used as the power for the electronic door strike (12 VDC
    models seem to be widely available).
    
    To set up a DO button, download and install the IFTTT "DO" app from 
    the App Store or Play Store.  Create a DO recipe with the action
    as "call a function" on the Particle IFTTT channel and select the
    "OpenDoor" cloud function on your Particle device.  Add the time
    for the relay to close (in milliseconds) as the optional function
    argument (e.g. 2000 for 2 seconds).  Name this DO button "open door"
    or whatever is most meaningful to you).
